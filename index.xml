      <description>Good Reads Collection Collecting good articles that I found over the period of time and small summaries about them.
Imposter Syndrome @ Amazon In this article, an Amazon employee confessed how he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hired at Amazon in the first place. He lacked a lot of technical and leadership skills. But over the period of 2 years, he grew himself to be a worthy SDE-2. He did it by collecting constructive feedback from his peers and reflecting on them.</description>

      <description>Introduction Well Hello there, Ankit this side. Welcome to my website/blog/brain-dump. I am a software engineer at Amazon. I am working here since February 2016. I am currently working on AWS Lambda Capacity team.
I am a life-hacker and believer that machines can help us live more enriched and satisfied life through automation. Sorry to &amp;ldquo;Robot will take our jobs&amp;rdquo; gang but yes &amp;ldquo;Robots will take your job someday&amp;rdquo;. I working day and night to make that happen :D.</description>

      <description>First Post So I have been trying to start a blog for so long. Precisely 2 long years. Since I started working at Amazon. My rate of learning has gone through the roof. I like gathering new ideas. Researching on them and apply them to my day-to-day life.
In my humble opinion, this blog is a result of that only. I am a software engineer by profession. So, I am well aware of the fact to make something work through automation rather than just pushing out the door.</description>
