      <title>FIRE yourself</title>

      <description>What is FIRE Let&amp;rsquo;s first start by defining FIRE. It is short for &amp;ldquo;Financial Independence Retire Early&amp;rdquo;. This is sort of an internet movement where people save until their very last penny. Invest that money wisely in a retirement account. Constantly track their progress and growth towards their goals. And when it is time, they say FU to their bosses and FIRE themselves from their job.
Who it is for It is for anyone who has a day-job and wants to not be in the same place for their entire life.</description>

      <description>Emacs Spreadsheet Started to use emacs spreadsheet. I will maintain good links and learnings as I use it. So far all my basic usecase to use Google Sheets has been taken care of.
I must say it is pretty seamless. Thanks Emacs.

      <description>Good Reads Collection Collecting good articles that I found over the period of time and small summaries about them.
Imposter Syndrome @ Amazon In this article, an Amazon employee confessed how he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hired at Amazon in the first place. He lacked a lot of technical and leadership skills. But over the period of 2 years, he grew himself to be a worthy SDE-2. He did it by collecting constructive feedback from his peers and reflecting on them.</description>

      <description>Introduction Well Hello there, Ankit this side. Welcome to my website/blog/brain-dump. I am a software engineer at Amazon. I am working here since February 2016. I am currently working on AWS Lambda Capacity team.
I am a life-hacker and believer that machines can help us live more enriched and satisfied life through automation. Sorry to &amp;ldquo;Robot will take our jobs&amp;rdquo; gang but yes &amp;ldquo;Robots will take your job someday&amp;rdquo;. I working day and night to make that happen :D.</description>

      <description>First Post So I have been trying to start a blog for so long. Precisely 2 long years. Since I started working at Amazon. My rate of learning has gone through the roof. I like gathering new ideas. Researching on them and apply them to my day-to-day life.
In my humble opinion, this blog is a result of that only. I am a software engineer by profession. So, I am well aware of the fact to make something work through automation rather than just pushing out the door.</description>
