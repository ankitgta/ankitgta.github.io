      <description>Good Reads Collection Collecting good articles that I found over the period of time and small summaries about them.
Imposter Syndrome @ Amazon In this article, an Amazon employee confessed how he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hired at Amazon in the first place. He lacked a lot of technical and leadership skills.
