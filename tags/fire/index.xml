      <description>What is FIRE Let&amp;rsquo;s first start by defining FIRE. It is short for &amp;ldquo;Financial Independence Retire Early&amp;rdquo;. This is sort of an internet movement where people save until their very last penny. Invest that money wisely in a retirement account. Constantly track their progress and growth towards their goals. And when it is time, they say FU to their bosses and FIRE themselves from their job.
Who it is for It is for anyone who has a day-job and wants to not be in the same place for their entire life.</description>
