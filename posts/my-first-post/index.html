<p>So I have been trying to start a blog for so long. Precisely <strong>2 long years</strong>. Since I started working at Amazon. My rate of learning has gone through the roof. I like gathering new ideas. Researching on them and apply them to my day-to-day life.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, this blog is a result of that only. I am a software engineer by profession. So, I am well aware of the fact to make something work through automation rather than just pushing out the door.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png" alt="Automation"></p>
<h1 id="static-site-generator">Static Site Generator</h1>
<p>So once I decided to start the blog. I immediately despised the fact that I need to brush up my high-school level HTML, CSS and JS chops which is well over 10 good years ago. So, I started looking ways to automate. I checked out Wordpress but it was an overkill for my simple usecase. Also I want more control over the selection of themes and resources on the blog. During the research, I was keep reading about the static site generator. Excuse me for not knowing all this. I am more of a cloud or systems engineer than general purpose Software Engineer. So, all this was pretty unknown to me. But as I was reading more and more on Static Site Generator, I was convinced that this is something that I will fit my usecase.</p>
<h1 id="hugo-for-the-win">Hugo for the Win!</h1>
<p>Then I explored into best static site generator in the market. The winning criteria was: Open Source, Speed, Documentation and Community Support. After the research was completed, Jekyll and Hugo came out to be the winners. Both are equal match but I went with <strong>Hugo</strong>, since I didn&rsquo;t want to learn <strong>Ruby</strong>. No offence Ruby, it is just I am not a big fan(personal story for another blog post).
Hugo was easy from the get go. I installed it for Windows OS. Then, followed their <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Get Started Guide</a> which was fairly straight-forward. I found a nice theme to go with my blog. Find the link here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/kskarthik/monopriv">Monopriv</a>.</p>
<h1 id="stay-tuned">Stay Tuned!</h1>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how this blogging came into reality. I am hoping to share lot more stuff here. So, stay tuned for more.</p>
